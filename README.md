## Acceptance Criteria

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

  ✅ - done

  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed

  ✅ - done



  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
